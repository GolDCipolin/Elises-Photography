    Hello there my name is Elise Doughnut <br>
    and I was born in Gujranwala located <br>
    in Pakistan. Ever since I was a kid <br>
    I had a passion for taking pictures. <br>
    I don't know why that was the case but I really <br>
    did enjoy it. When I was 8 years old my <br>
    parents got me a camera for my birthday <br>
    and ever since then I was taking pictures. <br>
    When I was around 17 years of age I was taking <br>
    pictures for my friends website because they had zero <br>
    and needed some so I decided to take the offer and <br>
    did it for free and in return would get a credit for the <br>
    pictures in the website. After that I had realised <br>
    I could do something like this but by getting paid by <br>
    other companies. So when I was 18 I decided to talk <br>
    with the multi millionaire Hassan Ahmed Khan <br>
    for his help. He had worked with multiple companies <br>
    so he would be the great opportunity for my career. <br>
    Ever since then I am working with multiple companies <br>
    such as National Geographic, Time, Daily Mail <br>
    and The Digital Photographer Magazine.

    "Elise is a wonderful person. <br>
     She has been a great person to work with <br>
     and I would recommend everyone to <br>
     check her out. She also does her work in <br>
     a good budget and came 2 weeks after I <br>
     had submitted her shooting form" - Jane Dough <br>

    "Elise is cool yo. I told her to take a few <br>
     shoots for my new drip and she did a great <br>
     job with that. If you need someone to take <br>
     some pictures of yourself I would highly <br>
     recommend her. Also check her website <br>
     out she is selling cheap and quality <br>
     photos." - Hassan Doe
